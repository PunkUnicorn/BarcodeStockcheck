      "title": "Taming the Tiger DVD Tony Anthony Author",
      "description": "This fast-paced, compelling and chilling account is the deeply moving story of a three-time Kung Fu World Champion. With fascinating insight into the traditions of China's martial arts, it documents the abusive upbringing that turned a four-year-old child into a hardened, professional killer. From China to Europe and across the Mediterranean, we follow Tony as he becomes an elite bodyguard, protecting some of the world's most powerful people. Following personal tragedy, Tony's extreme discipline and the philosophy of his art is quickly turned. He begins to use his skills for illegal means and highly destructive, bloodthirsty pleasure. Eventually incarcerated in jail in Cyprus, Tony hits rock bottom. Through the visits of a stranger, he is introduced to the reality and life-changing power of Jesus Christ. Though the prison walls hold him, he finds himself a free man. This is just the beginning of a complex and fascinating testimony. This DVD features live footage of Tony Anthony sharing his amazing story interspersed with 'docudrama' footage. This unique presentation (about an hour long) brings to life the story of 'Taming the Tiger' (and the children's edition 'Cry of the Tiger') and is a must for all fans of the book as well as being an excellent outreach tool.The book 'Taming the Tiger' has now sold almost 100,000 copies and has been translated into 17 languages. It won the 'CBC Book of the Year' award and the 2006 'CBA Biography of the Year'.",

      "description": "If you’ve spent any time listening to Christian music, the chances are you’ve already heard Lou Fellingham sing. Not only as a songwriter and worship leader but as a woman who has been an ever-present in the music industry for the last 20 years. An internationally known worship leader, six albums in to a firmly-established ministry, she is known for her prophetic edge, distinctive voice, unwavering energy to see lives changed through the power of music and word. With a heart that longs for people to know God and his outrageous love, Lou is tireless in her pursuit to write and record powerful songs and to lead people in singing truth that lifts their heads and stirs their hearts. Her critically acclaimed albums are packed with inspiring melodies wrapped around God exalting lyrics to remind us of who He is and who He has made us to be. ‘Ultimately we want the music we write to draw people to God. That by the power and presence of His Spirit people would have revelation of all that Jesus has done for us. That we can be restored to the Father. Worship is His gift to us. We’re made to worship our creator and He is worthy no matter what, but we find that as we give, we also receive.” Embodying authenticity, spiritual integrity and communicating the power of the gospel has always been the anchor of her music, underpinning and emphasizing her musical gifting.",
