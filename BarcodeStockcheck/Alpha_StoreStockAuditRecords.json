      "description": "Reflecting a wide range of musical styles, Spring Harvest Home 21 features worship from Tim Hughes &amp;amp; Gas Street, Lucy Grimble and Lou Fellingham with India’s Sheldon Bangera, Holland’s Kees Kraayenoord, and Gospel artist Muyiwa, adding an international flavour.  From the high praise of Love Won’t Stop and Imela to the adoration of Bring It All To Jesus and Blessed Assurance, the ebb and flow of worship is real and refreshing. Praise The Lord (Evermore) sums up the spirit of the album - a wholehearted desire to honour a glorious and gracious God.",

      "description": "This fast-paced, compelling and chilling account is the deeply moving story of a three-time Kung Fu World Champion. With fascinating insight into the traditions of China's martial arts, it documents the abusive upbringing that turned a four-year-old child into a hardened, professional killer. From China to Europe and across the Mediterranean, we follow Tony as he becomes an elite bodyguard, protecting some of the world's most powerful people. Following personal tragedy, Tony's extreme discipline and the philosophy of his art is quickly turned. He begins to use his skills for illegal means and highly destructive, bloodthirsty pleasure. Eventually incarcerated in jail in Cyprus, Tony hits rock bottom. Through the visits of a stranger, he is introduced to the reality and life-changing power of Jesus Christ. Though the prison walls hold him, he finds himself a free man. This is just the beginning of a complex and fascinating testimony. This DVD features live footage of Tony Anthony sharing his amazing story interspersed with 'docudrama' footage. This unique presentation (about an hour long) brings to life the story of 'Taming the Tiger' (and the children's edition 'Cry of the Tiger') and is a must for all fans of the book as well as being an excellent outreach tool.The book 'Taming the Tiger' has now sold almost 100,000 copies and has been translated into 17 languages. It won the 'CBC Book of the Year' award and the 2006 'CBA Biography of the Year'.",
